Project performed for the course Combinatorial Optimization, in collaboration with two other students. The project concerned a Constrained Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW), with the following precise [description](https://co2020-ba-vu.challenges.ortec.com/pdf/Challenge_problem.pdf). This version of the VRP is considered to be NP-hard; optimisation of routes is therefore considered to be hard.

For the project several methodologies were explored, of which greedy Cheapest Insertion proved to be the most useful. An example of a constructed route is displayed below ![Getting Started](./example_route.png)

The final implementation, together with an analysis of obtained results can be found in the [report](/files/VRP Case 33 Report.pdf).
