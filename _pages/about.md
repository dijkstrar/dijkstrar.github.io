**Study**
I am a fulltime business analytics student at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. My motivation for studying Business Analytics is because of my passion for problem solving and discovery of information in data.
The study brings me joy since I am constantly learning a wide variety of new and interesting things, such as in the combinatorial, stochastic or data science field. At the moment my interests are machine learning, web scraping, and optimization of processes.  In my bachelorâ€™s I have done a lot of interesting projects,  which allowed me to apply theory in practice, for example analyzing web-scraped lyrics. For a later job, I aim to do this as well, preferably in an energetic start-up environment, where I can get the freedom allowing me to do so.  

Currently looking for a study-related job in the field of Data Science and Data Analysis

I brew beers as a hobby. Brewed beers range from Belgian beers to German beers.
Most beers have ABV of around 7.5%.
