#Study
I am a fulltime business analytics student at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  My motivation for studying Business Analytics is because of my passion for problem solving, discovering information in data and since I am a number cruncher. 

Currently looking for a study-related job in the field of Data Science and Data Analysis

#Free Time
I brew beers as a hobby. Brewed beers range from Belgian beers to German beers.
