# Info
In my free time I brew a wide variety of beers. Beers I have brewed range from Blondes, Saisons and Tripels to Weizen's and Dubbels. For the future I aim to fine tune my beers, try dry-hopping and experiment with more beer styles.

# Set-Up
Beer is brewed with the help of a 10L pot, induction cooker and lots of water. First water is heated to 60°C, after which the malt is added. After an hour long mash (with varying temperatures), the malt is filtered out. Afterwards several hops are added to the boil. After boiling, the wort is cooled to 20°C and yeast is added. Finally the wort gets added to the fermenter and so the wait begins. After a two week fermentation the beer gets bottled (Grolsch 45cl bottles) after adding priming sugar. As two weeks have passed the beer is ready to drink! Brewed batches range from 5L to 7L.
