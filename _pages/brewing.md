# Info
In my free time I brew a wide variety of beers. Beers I have brewed range from Blondes, Saisons and Tripels to Weizen's and Dubbels. For the future I aim to fine tune my beers, try dry-hopping and experiment with more beer styles. Average batch sizes range from 5L - 7L.

# Maischen
Beer is brewed with the help of a 10L pot, induction cooker and lots of water. First water is heated to 60°C, after which the malt is added. This process is called "maischen". We maisch the beer to add add sugar to the wort, as the enzymes convert the starch to sugar. When maisching at high temperatures for a long time, the beer will get more 'body' and will taste less flat.

A simple scheme for maisching is:

| Temperature 	| Time    	|
|-------------	|---------	|
| 62°C          | 0:40:00 	|
| 72°C          | 0:10:00 	|
| 78°C          | 0:10:00 	|

# Boiling
After an hour long mash (with varying temperatures), the malt is filtered out. Afterwards several hops are added to the boil, in a specific order. Hops added early in the boiling process add to the bitterness of the final product (higher alpha acidity, is more bitterness), whereas hops added near the end of the boiling process contribute to the aroma of the final product. The amount of hops used for a beer vary per recipe. Moreover, to increase the amount of sugar present in the wort sugar may be added. When adding sugar, the percentage of alcohol in the final product increases, allowing to make more heavy beers.
For my latest beer, the following scheme was used.

| Additions             | Alpha Acid | Boil Time | Weight |
|-----------------------|------------|-----------|--------|
| Magnum                | 9.7%       | 1:00:00   | 6g     |
| Hallertauer Tradition | 4.3%       | 0:10:00   | 15g    |
| Hallertauer Tradition | 4.3%       | 0:01:00   | 15g    |
| Sugar                 | -          | 0:05:00   | 160g   |

# Cooling and Fermentation
After boiling, the wort is cooled to 20°C, as to make sure the added yeast does not immediately die.
As I do not have platecoolers or cooling-specific equipment, my beer gets cooled with the help of an ice-bath.

Finally the wort gets added to the fermenter and so the wait begins. The yeast ensures that the added and extracted sugar get converted to alcohol. The yeast greatly determines a portion of the taste of the final beer, as there exists a wide variety of yeasts, with wich I am still experimenting. An overview of multiple yeasts and taste-profiles can be found [here](https://www.beercraftr.com/beer-yeast-list/).
A watergate gets added to the fermenter, to ensure that produced CO2 can safely leave the fermenter, without oxygen and bacteria entering the fermenter. Working clean is very important, as beer in the fermenter can get infected easily.

# Final Product
After a two week fermentation the beer gets bottled (Grolsch 45cl bottles) after adding priming sugar. As two weeks have passed the beer is ready to drink!
